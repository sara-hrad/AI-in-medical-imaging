# MLP classifier using embeddings generated by the Google CT foundation model

Here, my experiments on imbalanced CTPE dataset are provided. The dataset including the generated embeddings 
is in this file:`dataset_imbalanced.csv`. To train MLP, random forest, and their ensemble models
run `train_model.py`. 

If you would like to generate your own embedding use `CT_Foundation_Demo.ipynb`; however,
make sure you are granted access to use this model.
