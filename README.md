# Develop Classifiers for Medical Imaging using Vision Transformers: Google CXR and CT foundation models.

To generate embeddings, make sure you are granted access to use these two models [CXR foundation model](https://github.com/Google-Health/imaging-research/blob/master/cxr-foundation/README.md) 
and [CT foundation model](https://github.com/Google-Health/imaging-research/tree/master/ct-foundation).

Here, several experiments have been conducted on several datasets including [NIH dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data) and
[CTPE dataset](https://www.rsna.org/rsnai/ai-image-challenge/rsna-pe-detection-challenge-2020)
